## Objectives

## 目标

As you read these words you are using a complex biological neural network. You have a highly interconnected set of some 10 11 neurons to facilitate your reading, breathing, motion and thinking. Each of your biological neurons, a rich assembly of tissue and chemistry, has the complexity, if not the speed, of a microprocessor. Some of your neural structure was with you at birth. Other parts have been established by experience.


Scientists have only just begun to understand how biological neural net- works operate. It is generally understood that all biological neural functions, including memory, are stored in the neurons and in the connections between them. Learning is viewed as the establishment of new connections between neurons or the modification of existing connections. This leads to the following question: Although we have only a rudimentary understanding of biological neural networks, is it possible to construct a small set of simple artificial “neurons” and perhaps train them to serve a useful function? The answer is “yes.” This book, then, is about artificial neural networks.

The neurons that we consider here are not biological. They are extremely simple abstractions of biological neurons, realized as elements in a pro- gram or perhaps as circuits made of silicon. Networks of these artificial neurons do not have a fraction of the power of the human brain, but they can be trained to perform useful functions. This book is about such neurons, the networks that contain them and their training.
